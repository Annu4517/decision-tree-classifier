Decision Tree Classifier 

This is my very first machine learning project.
I implemented a **Decision Tree Classifier** using Python and scikit-learn to learn the basics of classification models.

---

 Project Overview

* Built a Decision Tree to classify data.
* Learned how decision nodes and leaf nodes are created.
* Visualized the decision boundaries.

---

Tech Stack

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas, NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib / Seaborn

---

How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/decision-tree-classifier.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Decision_Tree.ipynb
   ```

Example Output

* Model training accuracy
* Confusion matrix
* Decision tree visualization

---

Future Improvements

* Add cross-validation for better accuracy.
* Compare with Random Forests.
* Try with real-world datasets.

This is my **beginner project**. I plan to keep uploading projects from basic → medium → advanced as I grow in machine learning.
